# CATAM-Ionisation

Gas near a star is fully ionised due to the high temperature of the star. However, at a certain distance away from the star, the fraction of the gas in the interstellar medium (ISM) that is ionised depletes to 0. The sphere that encloses this ionised gas is the Stromgren sphere.

This project determines how the ionisation fraction changes as a function of optical depth and distance from a star with varying properties (luminosity, surface temperature, mass).
